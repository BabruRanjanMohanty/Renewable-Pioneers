            <h2>We Are Pioneers In The World Of Renewable Energy</h2>
            <p>Pioneers have been around since the beginning of history, thinking outside the box to create, produce, and provide a better and more functioning life and world…

                Unlike the pioneers before us, our needs and the future for us has changed significantly. 
                We are no different from the pioneers of the past needing the urge to find a way to make a change for the better for us all. 
                Change doesn’t happen overnight and to be effective needs people from all walks of life to make their footprint on a more sustainable future. 
                Green Globe was established in 2024 with the vision to provide solutions for a sustainable energy future. 
                Founder & CEO, believes we need to take action to secure the sustainability of our planet. 
                For him solar was an easy first choice with the abundance of sunlight we receive in the prairies. 
                Growing up in Saskatchewan, SK green house gas emissions did not seem to be a cause for concern, however as we now know, it is imperative that we do our part to alleviate and eventually eliminate the harmful effects that GHG emissions have on our climate, and our health. 
                That is why we have made a commitment to transition to renewable energy consumption. 
                This will ensure the longevity of our communities and neighborhoods – not only by reducing our carbon footprint, but also through re-investing into our cities and citizens, and helping homeowners, businesses, and municipalities build out their capacity for clean energy infrastructure. 
                We continue to expand our horizons and seek out the most equitable sustainable energy solutions, so we can all enjoy a greener future. 
                We will continue to advocate for the adoption of renewable energy systems and help serve our communities in this way.
